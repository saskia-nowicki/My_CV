# Overview

As a social-ecological systems specialist, I do solution-focused research that cuts across natural, social, and health sciences to respond to long-standing and emerging water quality risks. I work collaboratively with interdisciplinary research teams and with partners beyond academia to co-produce insight that supports just transitions for healthy freshwater ecosystems and equitable safe water service delivery.
